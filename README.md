#30 Days Lost In Space Completed Code

This is a repository for the code taught in the video course by retired NASA researcher/College professor Dr. Greg Lyzenga. It is my intention that this code should represent the state of the code before any minor modifications are suggested at the end of the video. At present, the code some of the days are still showing the code after the final modifications.
